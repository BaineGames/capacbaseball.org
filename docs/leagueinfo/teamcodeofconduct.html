<h2 class="font-bold text-xl p-3">Team Code of Conduct</h2>
<div class="px-3"><p class="my-3">1. All Players are expected to maintain the highest level of good sportsmanship. Any negative
	comments about the other team, your team or any players on your team will not be tolerated. Any
	individual who argues or questions the umpire calls, this includes putting your hands up in the
	air after a call or comments like &quot;Nice Call&quot;, will be benched for the duration of the game and
	meet with the coaching staff to determine if you can play in any future games. &quot;We must win, lose
	and play with dignity.&quot;&quot; This rule applies to players and the coaching staff.
</p>
<p class="my-3">2. All players, who are attending a game, must play in the game. Coaches are encouraged to rotate
	players in multiple positions.
</p>
<p class="my-3">3. The coaching staff will make sure they evaluate each player in the position they are possibly
	going to play and will not overlook that opportunity. We have many things we are trying to
	accomplish during the game and need each player to focus on the position they have been asked to
	play and understand that every position on the field is just as important as any other.
</p>
<p class="my-3">4. All players are required to be at the field, on game day, no later than 30 Minutes prior to
	game time. Come ready to play, have water available to keep hydrated and have your uniform and
	equipment in good order. PLEASE DON&#39;T FORGET PART OF YOUR UNIFORM OR EQUIPMENT.
</p>
<p class="my-3">5. There will be no food in the dugout during games. Sunflower seeds, gum, water and Gatorade are
	allowed, but no other food or beverage.
</p>
<p class="my-3">6. There will be no cursing allowed in the dugout or on the field. Umpires will eject any player
	cursing on the field.
</p>
<p class="my-3">7. Any Players, Coaches, Parents or Fans that are determined, by the coaching staff or umpire, to
	be negatively impacting the players with their support or comments, will be asked to leave the
	field.
</p>
<p class="my-3">8. The coaching staff is responsible for all aspects of strategy, lineup, execution, and
	management of the games. Please remember this and avoid giving any contradicting instruction to
	the players during practice or games.
</p>
<p class="my-3">9. No Alcoholic Beverages will be allowed at any team event, practice or game. If the coaching
	staff determines that an order of alcohol is present, they will ask the person to leave the field.
</p>
<p class="my-3">10. Most sporting events take place on Public School Property where smoking is prohibited. Please
	respect this by not smoking while participating as a player, coach or fan.
</p>
<p class="my-3">11. No dogs are allowed at any of the Sporting Complexes that we will be playing at.</p>
<div class="w-full border-slate-200 border-2"></div>
<p class="my-3">These rules are established to ensure the best environment for the players and to maximize the
opportunity to win baseball games. If there is any conflicts you have with the rules, please contact
a board member from the above list, prior to game day, to discuss the problem. The coaching staff
may revise or add to this list of rules as required.</p></div></main></div></main>
